# Chicago PM2.5 Project
 
## Project Description
This [prototype tool](https://chicago-air-quality.herokuapp.com/) illustrates and compares 3 different PM 2.5 data sources, by day and neighborhood, in Chicago:

- ELPC community monitoring [data](https://airqualitychicago.org/)
- Environmental Protection Agency public air sample [data](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)
- Purple Air self-reported [data](https://www2.purpleair.com/)

Preliminary analysis results can be found [here](https://dtmlinh.github.io/bio/blog/2020/11/02/blog-post)

## This tool aims to:

- illustrate the trends of PM 2.5 measurements in the Chicago area for 4 summers: 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020
- identify days where the discrepancies (in terms of PM 2.5 levels) between AirQuality, EPA, and PurpleAir data are significant and locate the neighborhoods where these discrepancies might be coming from
- provide a more detailed view into specific neighborhoods, more specifically:
+ locate blocks with much higher average PM 2.5 levels
+ identify hours/time periods with much higher average PM 2.5 levels
